<img align = "left" style="padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src = "https://markhebing.github.io/images/MarkHebing33.jpeg" alt="Mark Hebing">**About:**  An analytical and physical chemist by trade working for [Linde PLC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linde_plc). Currently working in analytical, formulation and process chemistry within the petrochemical, refining, commodity, electronics and nuclear sectors.

Primarily involved in the development of methodologies used in the analysis, formulation, phase behavior modeling of and/or thermal decomposition (detonation) potential modeling of a large variety of specialty chemicals as well as gas and liquid mixture classes.

Currently studying coding and looking to develop scientific and engineering applications specific to energy, petrochemical, commodity, electronics manucacturing and nuclear industries specifically focusing on coding applications used in calculation and/or automation.

On a personal note, I have found coding to be both fun and rewarding and a very diverse field of study, much like chemistry. My interest in coding began with and is largely the result of interest in dark matter quantum computing theory ... specifically **[AND gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate)** architecture, a natural extension of optical and chemical physics.

Included is a link to a growing repository of simple [python scripts](https://github.com/markhebing/python-scripts) as well as a growing repository of simple HTML embeded [javascipts](https://github.com/markhebing/javascripts) that I have personally written that are based around function building as well as scientific and engineering calculations as well as a small amount of artificial intelligence and data mining. Additionally, included at the [bottom of this page](#science-and-engineering-scripts-and-calculators) is a growing list of scientific and engineering Javascripts that run in your browser.

**Personal Note:** I am fascinated by both computer architecture as well coding logic due to the notable parallels I have found between...

* advanced dark matter quantum physics => boolean logic
* chemistry => machine code
* biology => scripting and artificial intelligence

**Special Interests of Specific Relevance:** Analytical Chemistry, Phase Behavior, Chemical Physics, Dark Matter Chemistry, Dark Matter Chemical Physics, Dark Matter Materials, Advanced Dark Matter Materials Science, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Physics, Mass Uptake Isotope Physics, Quark Architecture, Fermionic Condensate, Ultraviolet Cloaking, Dark Matter Binary Mass Logic, Isotope Architecture Mass Offset, Advanced Dark Matter Isotope Materials, Para-Mass-Effect-Relativity
